#3. Cues
####
Cues are used to save lighting looks. To record a cue, change fixture colors to the desired color (cues **DO NOT** save intensity!!!) then on the
keypad to the left of the small screen, hit "**RECORD**" then "**CUE**" then hit the desired number for the cue. If this cue already exists, its
information will appear on the small screen. After you have chosen a cue number, you can enter information about how the cue will be processed.
"**FADE UP**" and "**FADE DOWN**" are pretty self-explanatory, they control the fade up and down timing by seconds ("**SNAP**" is instant).
"**NAME**" is also self-explanatory, as it is the name that appears on the cue page. "**COLOR**" changes how the cue fades into its colors.
"**SNAP@100%**" is not useful, "**SNAP**" causes the fixtures to immediately snap to the correct color, and "**FADE**" causes the colors to fade into each other.
It is recommended to use "**FADE**". "**BEAM SHAPE**" might control lighting similar to "**FADE UP**" and "**FADE DOWN**".
