#1: Fixtures
****

Fixtures are the lights. When you hit the "**FIXTURES**" button, a list of fixtures will appear on the side screen. They will all be next to a button.
When you hit a button, it will glow red indicating it has been selected. You can select multiple fixtures at once, but some may need to be exclusively selected,
or others in a group to edit (ex. intensity changes to master on some fixtures, this need to be edited by themselves, or in a group of the same type). When you have your fixtures selected,
you may change them by using the knob labeled "**INTENSITY**", or by going to one of the groups at the top, above the small screen.
