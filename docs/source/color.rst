#2: Intensity and Colors
####
On the FIXTURES page, the first knob is indicated as "INTENSITY" this is a value from 1-255 and is NOT saved in cues. The intensity knob
controls the light's brightness. The buttons above the screen (labeled color, beam, etc) control other aspects of the lights. The COLOR button
controls the light's color, using RGBW (red, green, blue, white). There is also sometimes a color wheel, that goes from 0-to 255 and controls the color.
When COLOR is above 0, the RGBW values have no effect. Other times the wheel isn't made of numbers, but rather names. These act
very similar to the 0-255 wheel, and can also not be changed.
